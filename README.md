# A Flask-React stack starter application

The following application is the simplest running example of a React frontend and a Flask backend. This application can be used to recreate or demo some features of the React documentation.

## Run the application

Launch React frontend:
```shell script
cd ./react-flask-app
npm start
```

Launch Flask backend:
```shell script
cd ./api
flask run
```

## Additional note

- Mark api directory as source.

- Need to create a virtual environment in the process with requirements installed.

```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
